  <h2>Welcome to the Blog About Itself</h2>
  <p>
    This isn’t just another demo site.  
    The <strong>Minimal Apple-Style Blog</strong> is both a 
    <em>free blog template</em> <u>and</u> a living guide that documents how it works.  
    Every post you see here is written in the same simple format that you can use 
    for your own blog — plain HTML files with clean design and ready-to-use ad slots.
  </p>

  <h3>Why a Self-Documenting Blog?</h3>
  <p>
    Most templates come with a boring README file. This project takes a different path:  
    the <strong>documentation is the blog itself</strong>.  
    Each article teaches you how to set up, customize, and monetize your own version.  
    In other words, you’re reading the instructions while seeing them in action.
  </p>

  <h3>Easy Setup, Zero Hassle</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>🚀 No database, no CMS, no subscriptions.</li>
    <li>📝 Just drop your <code>.html</code> posts into the <code>articles/</code> folder.</li>
    <li>🌍 Works instantly on GitHub Pages, Netlify, or any static host.</li>
    <li>💸 Built-in ad slots for monetization — no extra setup required.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Passive Income Potential</h3>
  <p>
    Let’s be real: not every blog makes money.  
    But this template removes <em>all the excuses</em>.  
    You don’t need to pay for hosting, subscribe to a service, or struggle with 
    technical setup. All you need is your content and a free hosting account.  
    Ads can handle the rest — giving you a chance at <strong>passive income</strong> 
    with almost zero investment.
